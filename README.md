## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Tik Tok
 - For You Page is full of content that is interesting to watch
 - platform encourages short videos

Youtube
- An ocean of videos about almost anything
- intuitive to use

Steam
- easy to use
- UI is well thought out and easy on the eyes
- a user review section for games

I would build an app that revolves around the Naruto anime. The app would have an intituitive interface with sections pertaining to Naruto wiki's. For instance, if a user wanted to learn more about Naruto characters, they would go to the section called "Naruto Characters" which hosts any information about all characters in the Naruto Universe. If a user wanted to learn more about Naruto games, they would navigate to the Naruto games section. This section would have a list of all naruto games that have released and any information pertaining to that game. Such information might include: release date, platform releases, game summary, public reception, game development hisory, etc. Some other sections this app would have are Manga chapters, Anime episodes, Fanart, Discussions, and more. The main goal of this app is to be the ultimate hub for Naruto enjoyers or those interested in learning about Naruto. 


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenge I enounctered while building the app was that some of the intructions didn't fully line up with my version of XCode. The problems were easily solved by googling walkthroughs through my version of XCode and the tutorial became easier to follow.
